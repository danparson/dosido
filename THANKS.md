# Special Thanks

Thank you to the following people, without whom Dosido would not be what it is today:

* **Garrison Osteen** - The founder of Misolrela, the Solresol community where I first discovered that there were more people interested in Solresol than myself
* **Andrew Warrington** - The acquirer of a digital copy of *Langue musicale universelle*, which has been a vital asset to the revival of Solresol
* **Misolsi Misido** - The founder of La Las√Ærela, a Solresol Discord server that has played a central role in the everyday communication of the community's efforts, and the "home" of Dosido
* **The Solresol Community** - There are too many people to list who have made significant contributions to the revival effort, but thank you to those past, present, and future.
